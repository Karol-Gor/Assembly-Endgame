# Assembly Endgame
Assembly Endgame is an alternative version of a classic hangman game where the words are either fetched from https://random-word-api.vercel.app/ or randomly chosen from a stored library if the API is unavailable. 

Project is implemented with React JS as a part of Scribma React course.
